The idea to to perform this analysis, initiated with the objective to the identify pleitropyc SNPs 
((i.e., variants associated with multiple distinct traits) using the GWAS Catalog summary statistics, 
and examine trait sharing per variant). However, without limiting myself to shared variants, 
I decided to study deeper a single trait at the time (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). 

The source code use to perform each single analysis if provide with details in the code file. 

First, download the data from database source

- Official complete and updated GWAS Catalog associations file is stored here:
  - URL: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative)
  - File: `gwas_catalog_v1.0.2-associations_e105_r2024-05-10.tsv` (or latest)

Download and place it in your working directory as (I would recommend to to keep it on you working directory/folder):

```bash
wget -O gwas_associations.tsv "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative"
```

Often for further analysis you will need harmonized GWAS data

Every day, a list of all harmonized GWAS studies gets updated. You can download it from the following link:

[Download Harmonized Studies List](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/harmonised_list.txt)

You can simply click the link above and save the file to your computer.

or, if you prefer using the terminal, you can download it with `curl` or `wget`:
  - Using `curl`:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/harmonised_list.txt
    ```
  - Using `wget`:
    ```bash
    wget https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/harmonised_list.txt
    ```

Formatted files are harmonized summary statistics for GWAS studies. Theyâ€™ve been cleaned and standardized, 
so all the data (like SNP identifiers and p-values) is consistent across studies. 
This makes them easier to work with for your analysis.
